## For this Project

For this project please download SESHAT's github repo from its original source at https://github.com/Narsil/seshat..

**NOTE** 
Note that the source code directly does not work out of the box, any "distance" in the code needs to be replaced by "std::distance". After this correction, the code will run as intended.
